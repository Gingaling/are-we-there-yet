# Presentations

Each presentation will be at most 7-8 minutes long to accommodate all our students. We recommend that you plan
your presentation ahead of time and practice running through it at least once.
About 3-4 minutes should be allotted for questions from the class. We suggest the following structure:

## Introduction

- What's your app called?
- Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?

## The Planning Process

- How did you arrive at this idea?
- What would you change about your planning process?

## Demonstrating Your App

- What are the integral features of your app?

## Demonstrating Your Code

- What was the most difficult part?
- What did you learn?
- What are you most proud of?

## Highs and Lows

- What worked well?
- What didn't?
- What features would you like to add?

## Presentation Schedule

Presentations will take begin at 11:00 am ET on Monday, 5/4 in our classroom channel. We will post a thread in the morning for students to sign up for presentations, and follow the order of the thread.
